# Four Factors College Basketball Model
Lasso Regression to project college basketball winning percentage using Dean Oliver's Four Factors

This project is my Fall 2024 honors project at Des Moines Area Community College. The discipline course is DAT303 - Data Science II and my advisor is Kevin Cook.

I started this project to see if I could reverse engineer Bill Connelly's SP+ for college basketball. Connelly uses Five Factors to create his ratings. I wanted to see if I could get similar results using Dean Oliver's Four Factors from his book Basketball On Paper.

Being a student and this being the first model of this kind that I have tried to create, I am open to all feedback and excited to see where and how I can improve!
